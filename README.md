# Face Recognition with YOLOv8 + FaceNet + KNN

A real-time, multi-person face-recognition system in Python.  
It detects faces with **YOLOv8**, generates **FaceNet** embeddings,  
and classifies known individuals using a **K-Nearest-Neighbors (KNN)** model.  
Unseen faces are automatically labelled **“Unknown”** using a distance threshold.

---

## ✨ Features
- **Real-time detection** of multiple faces from webcam or IP camera.
- **High-accuracy embeddings** with a pre-trained FaceNet model.
- **Distance-threshold rejection** so strangers are marked *Unknown*.
- **Dataset tools** to capture images and create embeddings.
- **Unified logging** with rotating log file for easier debugging.
